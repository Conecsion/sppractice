    * MotionCorr/job002/Movies/20170629_00030_frameImage.mrc
 + Will use following diameters for Laplacian-of-Gaussian filter: 
   * 30 (too low)
   * 38 (too low)
   * 50 (too low)
   * 75 (too low)
   * 150 (ok)
   * 165 (ok)
   * 180 (ok)
   * 360 (too high)
   * 540 (too high)
   * 720 (too high)
   * 900 (too high)
 + Will use micrographs scaled to 340 pixels as requested. The largest prime factor in FFTs is 19
